Today, he held good on his promise.In the Today FM studio, Mr Norris had his beard shaved off as part of the stationâs Shave or Dye fundraising campaign for cancer support.The Trinity College Senator was diagnosed with liver cancer four months ago. Discussing the disease, he said: âPeople should realise itâs not some sort of alien monster thatâs flown in on a flying saucer... itâs your own cells. Theyâre not behaving but theyâre yours.âMr Norris, who is 69 and has sported a beard for 40 years, feared that, like the Biblical figure of Samson, âall my strength may ebb away as I have my beard shavedâ.Indeed, he wasnât overjoyed with the result: âOh mother of god, isnât that dreadful,â he gasped after looking at his reflection. âI look like a bloody bank manager.âBut after a second look he reconsidered. âI think I look like Michael Noonan,â he said.Members of the public have been invited to donate to the Shave or Dye campaign, benefiting the Irish Cancer Society and Professor John Crownâs Cancer Research Trust.To donateâ¬2 text SHAVE to 50300.
