The winter vomiting bug (Norovirus) is highly contagious.âThe hospital is urging members of the public who are symptomatic of Norovirus to seek medical advice from their local GP before presenting to Beaumont Hospital emergency department,â Beaumont Hospital said in a statement.âThis is against the backdrop of an increased incidence of the winter vomiting bug in the community. Visitor exemptions may be granted at ward level in exceptional circumstances only.â
