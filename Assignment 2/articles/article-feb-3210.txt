File Photograph: Brenda Fitzsimons/The Online NewsMinister for Children Frances Fitzgerald has defended the Governmentâs decision to locate the new national childrenâs hospital at St Jamesâs Hospital .She was responding to a report in todayâs Online News [MON]that An Taisce had called on the Government to move the site from St Jamesâs to land beside the Coombe Hospital nearby.An Taisce had written to Taoiseach Enda Kenny saying the apparent failure to co-locate the hospital with a maternity hospital, as recommended in a number of expert reports, âsends alarm bells ringingâ.Ms Fitzgerald said the Government had taken âthe very best decisionsâ in relation to the location for the childrenâs hospital. âWe are committed to it. The money has been put aside and we are moving ahead with it,â she said.She denied that the failure to locate the new hospital on the site of a maternity hospital was an oversight. âObviously all these factors were considered and the very best decision was taken about the location of the childrenâs hospital. Whatâs important now is to get on with all of the issues to make sure that itâs delivered on target and thatâs the Governmentâs intention.âThe new hospital will bring together the three existing Dublin childrenâs hospitals at Crumlin, Tallaght and Temple Street.
