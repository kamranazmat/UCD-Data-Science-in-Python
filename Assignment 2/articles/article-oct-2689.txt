Photograph: Jonathan Ernst/Online NewsUS Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke said last night the Fed will maintain ultra-easy US monetary policy for as long as needed, which could mean holding interest rates near zero until âwell afterâ US unemployment falls under 6.5 per cent.In a speech to the National Economists Club that echoed dovish comments by his nominated successor, Janet Yellen , Mr Bernanke also said that while the economy had made significant progress, it was still far from where officials wanted it to be.âThe FOMC remains committed to maintaining highly accommodative policies for as long as they are needed,â he told the club, referring to the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee .US president Barack Obama nominated Ms Yellen, the Fedâs current vice chair, to replace Mr Bernanke when his term ends on January 31st.The Fed has held interest rates near zero since late 2008 and quadrupled its balance sheet to $3.9 trillion through three massive rounds of bond buying. It decided in October to maintain asset purchases at an $85 billion monthly pace.Mr Bernanke said officials want evidence of durable job growth before scaling back buying.âThe FOMC still expects that labor market conditions will continue to improve and that inflation will move toward the 2 per cent objective over the medium term. If these views are supported by incoming information, the FOMC will likely begin to moderate the pace of purchases,â he said.Fed officials meet next on December 17th-18th, although most economists do not think they will begin to scale back the bond buying until their meeting in either January or March.Online News
