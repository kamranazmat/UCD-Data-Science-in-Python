Brussels ruled the deal had moved, but not reduced, Berlinâs own liabilities to the postal pension fund.Germanyâs federal court of auditors was similarly critical, accusing Berlin of creative accounting to âpush liabilities into the futureâ.The juggling failed to reduce Berlinâs deficit, though the advising investment bankers still earned â¬83 million on the deal.Further Irish companiesDespite this, Mr Eichelâs successor, Mr SteinbrÃ¼ck, continued the practice â covering the stateâs pension liabilities with securitised pension obligations. To save taxes on the transactions, Berlin set up further companies in Ireland, named German Postal Pensions Securitisation 1 and 2.With the securitisation income now paid up-front, Berlin now has to shoulder â alone â the remaining cost of 275,000 pensioners.Worse, the pension fund members were told that some â¬2.8 billion in income from the Irish-based companies was invested in special-purpose vehicles including those of Dexia , the failed Belgian-French bank nationalised in 2011 with â¬90 billion of public money.The SPDâs use of Irish firms to juggle pensions payments and save taxes could be an interesting point of discussion when TÃ¡naiste Eamon Gilmore visits Berlin this week.On Mr Gilmoreâs last visit to Berlin, in October last year, Mr SteinbrÃ¼ck used a public discussion forum to criticise Irelandâs tax rate.âIf Germany is making available its creditworthiness to others, we expect others to improve their own revenue base,â said Mr SteinbrÃ¼ck.
