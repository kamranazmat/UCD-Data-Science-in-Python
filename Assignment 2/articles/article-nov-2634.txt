It will be sent to every primary school and county library in the State by the Health and Safety Authority (HSA) in a bid to reduce the number of deaths on farms.Four children were among the 16 deaths on farms this year. Mr Coveney said the childrenâs stories and art showed how great farming life was - but also how dangerous farms could be. âAnd many have witnessed their parents, grandparents and others take risks and suffer the awful consequences,â he said.âI am calling on farmers to take more responsibility, and stop taking unnecessary risks, for their own sake and for the sake of the next generation.âHSA chief executive Martin OâHalloran said the 86 children who contributed were among 9,500 children who entered in the farm safety competition.â Their stories are funny, moving and life-affirming. Some have written about lessons learnt the hard way. Itâs time now to heed this new generation,â he said. âI would appeal directly to all adults working on farms, particularly parents and grandparents, to think about the example they are showing to children and young people and to always find a way to work safely.âWe need to see a change of mindset amongst some farmers now, to ensure we donât create a new generation of risk-takers in farming.â
