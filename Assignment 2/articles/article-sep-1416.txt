It is not easy, sometimes it feels like she is not gone but then we know it is true. We came today to remember our friend,â he said.Another close friend, Vishali Valluri, said Savita was an incalculable loss to all who knew her.âI still think she canât be gone. She was my very good friend and I miss her every day. We thought she would make it, I never thought she would die. Itâs still very hard every day but especially today,â she said.Cork vigilA separate vigil outside Cork Opera House was attended by more than 40 people. Maureen Considine , co-founder of Cork Feminista, who handed out candles at the vigil, said the passing of Savita had had a profound impact on Irish society.âWhen the first vigil was organised last year I turned to my partner and said âWe are going.â I felt that what happened to Savita could have happened to any of us.âMs Considine described Praveen Halappanavar as an âamazing manâ. âHe has made the effort to continue to speak about this publicly at a time of great difficulty. He has been a profound gift to us all. This vigil is about remembering Savita and honoring the Halappanavar family. We want to show solidarity with them.âJoe Moore said Savita lost her life in a shocking and senseless manner. âPraveen has shown such strength and courage over the last 12 months.â
