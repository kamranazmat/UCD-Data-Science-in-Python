Primary healthcare minister says shift  is âcoreâ to sustainable health servicesMinister with responsibility for primary health care Alex White has said: âThe commitment in the programme for government to achieve free GP access for the entire population within the term of office of this Government will be achieved.â  Photograph: Brenda Fitzsimons/The Online NewsParents will be able to access free GP care for their children aged under five âsometime in the middle of next yearâ, the Minister with responsibility for primary health care Alex White has said.The measure, which will cost â¬37 million in a full year, is currently going through the Oireachtas , but no consultations have yet taken place with doctors, Mr White revealed this morning.He acknowledged that âpeople are entitled to be scepticalâ in relation to the implementation of the Governmentâs commitment to deliver free GP care for the whole population by the end of its term in the spring of 2016.However, he said there was not a healthcare system in the world that will be able to sustain itself unless the emphasis is put on primary care. âWe canât do that with the barriers of fees.âWeâre one of the few countries in the OECD that charges people to go and see their doctor.âWhen pressed by Sean OâRourke on RTÃ Radio Oneâs Today with Sean Rourke show as to the start date for free GP care, Mr White responded: âThe commitment in the programme for government to achieve free GP access for the entire population within the term of office of this Government will be achieved.âFor me this is core. We will not be able to sustain our health services in the future unless we do this.âMinister for Health Dr James Reilly declined to make a cast-iron commitment to the introduction of free GP care by 2016 when he was interviewed by RTÃ presenter Brian Dowling .Mr White said they had not opened discussions with GPs about the implementation of free care for the under-5s, but he was confident of success. âWe will talk to the doctors about this. Iâm sure we will have the co-operation of the doctors in this.âIt is not a question of giving any section of society a veto over Government policy. We canât do this on our own. We need the co-operation of the medical profession and I think weâll get it.âMr White said he was not personally persuaded by the idea that the State could not introduce a ban on alcohol sponsorship of sporting events because it might stop Ireland getting the Rugby World Cup in 2023.âThere will always be another event. There will always be an another objective. I donât want to fall out with anybody in relation to that. I can understand where Minister Varadkar is coming from in relation to this issue.âWhen asked whether he was in favour of the return of the âholy hourâ where the pubs had to close in the afternoon, he responded: âThere was a time in the past when you think those type of rules are overly constraining. Personally, I donât think there was such a bad idea.âHowever, they were not in the package of measures to deal with alcohol as a public health issue, as distinct from a public order issue, for the first time..
