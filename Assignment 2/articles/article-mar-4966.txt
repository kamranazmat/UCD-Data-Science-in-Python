Photograph: Bryan OâBrienThe HSE has said that top-up payments for the chief executive and other senior staff in the Central Remedial Clinic (CRC) were ânot at any stage agreed to or sanctionedâ.The statement comes after a former chair of the CRC, Des Peelo claimed earlier today that two of the âvery top peopleâ in the HSE attended a meeting in 2009 at which privately-funded top-up payments for nine people in the organisation were agreed to.In an interview on RTÃ Radio 1 this morning, Mr Peelo said that, in a meeting held in June 2009, the HSE had agreed to fund the salaries up to the end of the year after which point the difference over and above the HSE-funded portion of the salaries would be funded privately.He said the HSE was âfully awareâ of this arrangement and that âevery year since 2010 the HSE get a list of salaries and they know about it...itâs been fully on the record and agreed with the HSEâ.Minister for Health James Reilly today met the director general of the HSE Tony OâBrien to seek an update on unsanctioned payments to management at organisations receiving funding under Section 38 of the 2004 Health Act.The Department of Health said Dr Reilly requested âurgent action to ensure that every agency is fully compliant with Government pay policyâ.âThe HSE will take whatever actions are necessary to deliver full compliance and ensure that any governance deficits identified are comprehensively rectified immediately. Meetings are now being arranged with each agency concerned,â the department said.âArising from this process, those found not to be compliant will be called in by the Director General to meet him before Christmas. Such meetings will commence next week.âA statement from the Central Remedial Clinic, released this evening, said that, in 2009, it had agreed with the HSE to phase out any existing management salaries being paid over and above the Department of Healthâs consolidated pay scales but that âin the meantime, the difference between the Department of Health pay scales and the contractually obligated salaries of these staff would be funded by the Central Remedial Clinic through the lottery proceeds received by the Friends of the CRCâ.âThis has been the case since then with regular reports being sent to the HSE confirming the portion of salaries being paid through both sources.â the statement said.However, the HSE this evening in a statement said: âThe arrangement entered into by CRC with its former chief executive and other senior staff at the organisation was not at any stage agreed to or sanctioned by the HSE. All HSE funded agencies are expected to comply with public pay policyâ.
