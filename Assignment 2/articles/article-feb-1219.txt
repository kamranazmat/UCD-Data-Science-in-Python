Fiscal discipline key to keeping finances on an even keel, says Central Bank governorGovernor of the Central Bank of Ireland Patrick Honohan: âI actually favour the clean exit though a case can be made for the other approach.â   Photograph: Gareth Chaney CollinsColin GleesonThe governor of the Central Bank Patrick Honohan has said he is in favour of the Governmentâs decision to exit the bailout without a credit line.Speaking on RTEâs Prime Time last night, he said there were risks attached â but that there are âways of protecting against risksâ.âI actually favour the clean exit though a case can be made for the other approach,â he said. âWeâve come to the end of an important stage in the restabilisation of the Irish economy. Going ahead now there are a lot of other things that help us move forward apart from a precautionary credit line for another year.âI volunteered my advice to Michael Noonan. I gave a balance between two options. In no way was it like the last time three years ago. I wasnât saying this is definitely the way to go one way or the other.âI felt the Government could choose between the options here and I waited to see what they would say. They opted for a clean exit and actually I would have done the same for Ireland.âAsked about the practical benefits of exiting the bailout without a credit line, Mr Honohan said it was a âstatement of intentâ from the Government before entering the markets.âFrom now on we are dealing with markets and convincing markets that we, Ireland, are credit-worthy and a credible counterpart. This is a statement of intent that the Government intends to continue on a path of discipline in its approach and action to support economic recovery.âEconomic growth and fiscal disciple are the two things that keep our finances on an even keel. By going in this way, I think it helps convince the markets.âMr Honohan said there are still many obstacles for Dublin to overcome in terms of ensuring a return to healthy economic growth for Ireland. âItâs a constant negative that growth is so much below potential in the Euro zone,â he said.âThere is no dispute about this. Six quarters of recession have been followed by two quarters of very low growth so that is a weak environment in which to sustain and build the Irish recovery.âIn terms of when people on the ground might begin to see an improvement in their day-to-day lives, he said the signs were pointing in âa positive directionâ.âThe growth has started to recover. I donât want to be too optimistic but I have to say the signs are all in a positive direction. It isnât being felt by a large number of people. Some are feeling it but a large number are not and they will not get back to the living standards of five years ago â thatâs for sure â but the direction is positive on a range of fronts.â
