The bedside test can give a result in 15 minutes and is able to identify 96 per cent of pregnant women at high risk of the condition.It was developed by British scientists who studied a group of 625 pregnant women from across the UK, 61 per cent of whom were affected by pre-eclampsia.The condition can damage the kidneys, liver and brain and lead to premature delivery, low birthweight babies and stillbirths.High blood pressureDr Lucy Chappell , senior lecturer in obstetrics at Kingâs College London, said: âThe test is designed to differentiate women with pre-eclampsia from those with high blood pressure alone. Current tests for the condition only detect that itâs happening, rather than predicting it, and by that time the disease has progressed and has likely already caused organ damage.âDr Chappell and Prof Shennan now plan to conduct a trial of the test in the UK and Ireland . â PA
