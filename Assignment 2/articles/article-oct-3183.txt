Proposed changes for pregnant women should be stopped, they sayPrime Minister David Cameron speaking at the Invest Northern Ireland investment conference at the Titanic Belfast, yesterday. Photograph: Niall Carson/PA.European Union rules, particularly those applying to small companies, must be reduced, or abolished, some of Britainâs most influential business leaders will today tell UK prime minister David Cameron .EU legislation strengthening the rights of women during and after pregnancy âshould be withdrawnâ while mandatory rules governing the posting of sub-contracted workers between EU states should not be introduced, says the group which includes Marc Bolland , Marks and Spencerâs chief executive,  and Paul Walsh , former chief executive  of Diageo .New employment laws should be rare, while small businesses should be automatically exempted, unless a good reason exists. Meanwhile, one-man gardening firms, carpenters and other small contractors should not face registration fees for transporting non-toxic waste. Small businesses in non-risky occupations should not have to keep written health and safety risk assessments â a change which would save â¬2.7 billion a year.Latest Economy
