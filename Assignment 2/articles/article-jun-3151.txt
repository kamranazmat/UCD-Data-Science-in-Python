Photograph: Cyril Byrne/The Online NewsMark HilliardThe body representing Irish third-level students has withdrawn from the DrinkAware campaign, citing concerns over its ties to the alcohol industry and muted response to Arthurâs Day celebrations.DrinkAware.ie promotes âresponsible drinkingâ. It was set up in 2006 by the Moderate Enjoyment of Alcohol group, an industry-funded body.In a recent letter to Meas chief executive Fionnuala Sheehan , the Union of Students Ireland (USI) said it was no longer co-operating with the initiative following a vote of its national council earlier this month.âIt is felt that we are best placed to develop a student alcohol awareness campaign independently through working with other bodies that are not funded by a self-regulating drinks industry,â wrote USI president Joe OâConnor and deputy Denise McCarthy.âIt may be important to note for your own internal purposes that the continued promotion of the Arthurâs Day festival by Diageo further deepened our concerns regarding the credibility of your alcohol awareness campaign.âMs Sheehan said DrinkAware was a âsocial responsibility organisationâ, not a prohibition body. It had never hidden the fact it was funded by the industry and remained independent of it. She pointed to a Millward Brown survey for DrinkAware.ie in which 81 per cent said it was effective âwithout pointing the fingerâ.âThis would seem to suggest that separate from any opinion that some USI officers may currently hold, very many individual students see the value of the work being undertaken,â Ms Sheehan said.
