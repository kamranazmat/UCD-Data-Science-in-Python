The official Xinhua News Agency said that was an upgrade from the âcore roleâ assigned to the market in party policy over the past two decades.It gave no indication the meeting considered any political reforms in Chinaâs closed, secretive one-party system. It said a national security council would be set up to improve security strategy.Chinese leaders are under pressure to replace a growth model based on exports and investment that delivered three decades of rapid expansion but has run out of steam. Reform advocates say Beijing should open an array of state-controlled industries to private competition, but any moves to curb the privileges of politically favored companies are likely to face resistance.The party said it will create a committee to âdeepen reformsâ and gave no indication when more changes might be approved. That suggested party leaders, as many observers expected, agreed on broad themes but put off battles over details such as the status of state companies that control vast swathes of Chinaâs economy including banking, energy and telecoms.Another key area that reformers say is ripe for change is control of land. The report said farmers should have more property rights but made no commitments.All land in China is owned by the state. Farmers are tenants who cannot mortgage or rent their land to buy better seeds and technology. Giving them ownership or at least more control would unlock wealth in the countryside but also might jolt real estate markets and affect local governments that rely on sales of land use rights for revenue.Because of that, some analysts said land reform is likely to be left until later.Before the meeting, communist leaders raised hopes and the political stakes by promising âunprecedentedâ reforms.The meeting was seen as symbolically significant because it was the 205-member Central Committeeâs third plenum â or full meeting â of the partyâs 18th congress. Such meetings at this point in the partyâs five-year political cycle are seen as a launching pad for changes in economic direction after Deng Xiaoping used a third plenum in 1978 to unveil his reforms.The plenum offered a platform for president Xi Jinping, who became party leader last year, to make clear his own vision for the worldâs second-largest economy.Communist leaders have been trying to make the economy more efficient and productive by gradually injecting more market forces into areas such as bank lending. Regulators eliminated controls on interest rates charged on commercial loans in July in a move that ultimately will lower costs for borrowers with stronger credit records.Pressure for change has mounted as economic growth tumbled to a two-decade low of 7.5 per cent in the second quarter of this year. Beijing propped up growth with a mini-stimulus of higher spending on railway construction and other public works but premier Li Keqiang , the top economic official, has said the leadership wants to focus on longer-term reforms.The government still dominates Chinaâs economy three decades after Mr Dengâs market-style reforms set its boom in motion. Entrepreneurs create Chinaâs new jobs and wealth but are treated as second-class corporate citizens and have trouble getting bank loans.The report called for ensuring the publicâs livelihood and social stability. That would include both more spending on welfare programs to ease political tensions and more intensive monitoring and policing to defuse ethnic unrest or potential political dissent.Its focus, though, was economic change, which it said will be âthe key of overall deepening of reform.â.
