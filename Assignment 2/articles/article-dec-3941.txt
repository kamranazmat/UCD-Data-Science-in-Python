Chancellor says criticism of  German current-account surplus not justifiedGerman chancellor Angela Merkel: âThe current-account surpluses are a sign of the competitiveness of the German economy and global demand for quality products from Germany.â  Photo/Yves HermanGerman chancellor Angela Merkelâs government has hit back at a US treasury department report that criticised Germany for running an extended trade surplus.The issue is a key one in the debate over the EUâs response to its economic crisis and whether Germany should do more to help countries such as Ireland and Spain.The US report targeted Germany for maintaining a current-account surplus throughout the four-year-old European debt crisis and said policymakers hadnât done enough to bolster domestic demand, delaying a resolution to the crisis.âThe criticism is not justified,â the German economy ministry said. âThe current-account surpluses are a sign of the competitiveness of the German economy and global demand for quality products from Germany.âDiplomatic falloutThe spat over economic policy coincides with the diplomatic fallout over US spying on allies and the possible tapping of Dr Merkelâs mobile phone. The chancellor dispatched a team of officials to the White House to begin repairing political damage following the spy disclosures.In the economic sphere, German officials have repeatedly fended off accusations that the countryâs export-led economic growth has been generated at the expense of domestic consumption that would alleviate imbalances in the euro area.ReboundWhile the US  acknowledged a rebound in domestic demand in Europeâs largest economy, German growth âcontinues to rely on positive net exports, which continues to delay the euro areaâs external adjustment processâ.The toll is being taken by indebted euro countries such as Ireland and Greece, which have come under âsevere pressure to curb demand and compress imports in order to promote adjustment,â according to the US report.âThe net result has been a deflationary bias for the euro area, as well as for the world economy,â the Treasury said.Dr Merkel has said that her government has done enough to spur consumption, while championing Germanyâs export-heavy policy as a model for others to follow. â (Online News)
