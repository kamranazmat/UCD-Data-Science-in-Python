Three-quarters of boys take part in team sports compared to half of girls, while 46 per cent of boys take daily physical exercise, against 39 per cent of girls.For many girls, their physical exercise is confined to walking, with only hockey, camogie, GAA and basketball being participated in by girls to any great extent.Virtually all teenagers say they are happy and feel great mentally, with 88 per cent saying they feel great physically.When asked whether they would prefer to look good or feel healthy, 16 per cent opted for looking good. Some 14 per cent of teenagers said they were concerned about their heart health.The survey was released to coincide with the second year of the Pumped Schoolsâ Video Awards by Leinster rugby player Fergus McFadden and Olympic pentathlete Natalya Coyle .Mr McFadden said it was important to get the message out to young people about the need to look closely at what they are eating and how much exercise they are taking.More information on the competition, which is supported by the Irish Heart Foundation and the Federation of Irish Sport, is available from pumped.ie.
