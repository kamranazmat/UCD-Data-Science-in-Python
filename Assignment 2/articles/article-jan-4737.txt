These findings ... were made and analyzed by this yearâs Laureates,â the academy said.Shiller helped create a closely watched gauge of US housing prices and in June this year warned of a potentially new housing bubble in some of Americaâs largest cities.Fama, tipped as a Nobel winner for many years, has been called the father of modern finance and is well-known for research showing that certain groups of stocks tend to outperform over time. The behaviour of asset prices are key to decisions such as savings, house buying and national economic policy, the academy said.âMispricing of assets may contribute to financial crises and, as the recent global recession illustrates, such crises can damage the overall economy,â it added. Fama and Hansen are professors at the University of Chicago, while Shiller is a professor at Yale University .âA lot of people had told me they hoped I would win it, but I am aware that there are so many other worthy people that I had discounted it, so I would say no, I did not expect it,â Schiller told a news conference. The economics prize, officially called the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel, was established in 1968. It was not part of the original group of awards set out in dynamite tycoon Nobelâs 1895 will.Latest Economy
