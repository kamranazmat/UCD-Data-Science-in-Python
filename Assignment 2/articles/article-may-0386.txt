Tobacco giant says plain packaging could lead to  State compensationLegal opinion commissioned by cigarette producer says James Reillyâs plan could come at âhigh priceâ for taxpayerThe Government last week approved the first draft of laws to allow for plain packaging.Fiach KellyThe worldâs largest tobacco company has warned the Government the introduction of plain packaging for cigarettes could lead to âan extremely high priceâ of compensation being paid to multinational tobacco companies by the taxpayer.Philip Morris Ltd, the British arm of Philip Morris International , which is responsible for cigarette brands such as Marlboro, commissioned a legal opinion in response to proposals to introduce plain packaging in the Republic. It said such moves would not âwithstand legal scrutinyâ without providing compensation to the tobacco companies involved.The opinion and accompanying letter, seen by The Online News, were sent to Minister for Finance Michael Noonan and Minister for Health James Reilly . The legal opinion, drafted by Michael M Collins SC, warned that the legal implications of banning tobacco branding were âpredictable and starkâ.The Government last week approved the first draft of laws to allow for plain packaging, the Public Health (Standardised Packaging of Tobacco) Bill, which will also allow for larger warnings on standard packets.Philip Morrisâs letter, sent last June, said plain packaging and larger health warnings involve similar legal issues.
