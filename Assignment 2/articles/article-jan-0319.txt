Lack of sleep also appears to be an important factor.Scientists made the discovery after adjusting the sleep patterns of 37 children aged eight to 11, more than a quarter of whom were overweight or obese.When children increased their sleep, they reported consuming an average 134 fewer calories per day and lost half a pound in weight.Tests showed they had lower fasting levels of the hunger-regulating hormone leptin.âFindings from this study suggest that enhancing school-age childrenâs sleep at night could have important implications for prevention and treatment of obesity,â said Dr Chantelle Hart, from Temple University in Philadelphia . âThe potential role of sleep should be further explored.âThe findings are published in the journal Pediatrics.Dr Hart is now working on a follow-up study to determine whether increased sleep produces significant changes in eating patterns, activity, and weight.âGiven all of its documented benefits, in many ways, you canât lose in promoting a good nightâs sleep,â she added. - PA
