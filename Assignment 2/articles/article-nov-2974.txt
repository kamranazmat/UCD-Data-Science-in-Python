Five changes  the Government are tipped to announce todayA revision of the 9 per cent tourism VAT rate:When the VAT rate on restaurants, hotels and other hospitality and tourism sector businesses was reduced by Minister for Finance Michael Noonan in July 2011, it was intended only as a short term measure. The cut from 13.5 per cent to 9 per cent has been credited with supporting thousands of Â jobs, but that could be about to come to an end. The Minister for Finance has indicated that he will be increasing it again in this yearâs budget, although itâs not expected to return to 13.5 per cent.Free GP care for under-fives:The pension cap:The Governmentâs decision to cap tax relief on pensions delivering retirement incomes above â¬60,000 has been well flagged, but this yearâs Budget will provide more detail on exactly how it will work. Whatever the form it takes, the measures are expected to affect about 27,000 people.Reducing job seekersâ allowance again:If the leaks are anything to go by, itâs more bad news for those struggling to get a job. The payment of â¬100 for new entrants under 22 years of age is rumoured to be extended to those under 25, and you will have to be 26 before the full rate kicks in.Incentives for construction:The construction industry has been hard hit since the economic downturn. Lobby groups have been seeking the introduction of some sort of incentive to help rebuild the sector, but how much the minister will give them is not yet clear. There are rumours of tax breaks for homeowners who use reputable contractors for home projects, according to the Irish Independent, and a stimulus package of â¬200 million for capital projects is expected to be announced..
