Former Fed chief says US economy will grow more slowly next year than expectedAlan Greenspan, former Federal Reserve chairman,  said the stock market is not in a bubble, even as the Dow Jones Industrial Average breached 16,000 and the Standard & Poorâs 500 has climbed above 1,800, leaving both measures at record levels. Photographer: Andrew Harrer/Online NewsFormer US Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan said the US economy probably will grow more slowly next year than some forecasters predict and indicated that a near-record US stock market was not in a bubble.âThis does not have the characteristics, as far as Iâm concerned, of a stock market bubble,â Mr Greenspan said in an interview with Online News Television, which is due to air this weekend.âIt could come out that way but I donât see it at this stage.âMr Greenspan said that even with the rise in equities, the US economy is restrained by a âdegree of uncertaintyâ that is reducing investment.Economists who forecast 2.5 per cent to 3 per cent growth next year may be too optimistic, he said. âItâs a little on the upside, frankly,â Mr Greenspan said. âThereâs no doubt that thereâs been some acceleration going on, but thereâs an overall suppression that is going on in the economyâ largely because of lingering uncertainty, he said.Mr Greenspan said his 2014 growth forecast is âcloser to 2 per cent.âHe said the economy is being held back in part by the banking system, as some of the largest banks are not operating efficiently.âWeâre supporting banking institutions who are not only very large, but not very efficient and they are using the scarce savings of the society, which is critical for economic growth,â he said.He declined to identify which banks had become inefficient. The Standard and Poorâs 500 Index has rallied about 27 per cent this year, heading for the biggest annual gain since 1998, as the Fed has pressed on with its stimulus campaign.The S&P 500 climbed 0.2 per cent to 1,806.85 in New York yesterday, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.2 per cent to 16,097.46. Both indexes reached records this week. âThe stock price generally goes up about 7 per cent a year for the long term,â Mr Greenspan said.âIt didnât go anywhere since October 2007 and the result of that is weâre just now breaching that. We have had no growth in stock prices for years.âThe S&P 500 reached 1,565.15 on October 9th, 2007, and then dropped 57 percent as the economy went through the longest and deepest recession since the Great Depression. The index didnât surpass its October 2007 peak until March of this year.Mr Greenspan also offered praise for Janet Yellen , the nominee to be the next Fed chairman. She was approved by the Senate banking committee with a vote of 14-8 on November 21st and now heads to the full Senate.Ms Yellen (67) was a governor at the Fed from 1994 to 1997 under MrGreenspan and became president of the San Francisco Fed during the final years of Mr Greenspanâs tenure, which ended in January 2006.Online NewsLatest Economy
