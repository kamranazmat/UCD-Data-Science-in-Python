And the OECD also sees downside risks in Chinaâs public debt problem, which lingers from Chinaâs massive stimulus programme during the global financial crisis in 2008-2009.âThere are also downside risks, notably stemming from local public debt. Mishandled defaults, were they to occur, might jeopardise the health of the banking system and confidence in capital markets,â it added.OECD chief economist Pier Carlo Padoan said in an interview with Online News : âWhat sets China apart is that it has been growing because of structural change as the government addressed the economyâs weaknesses quickly. Itâs becoming more and more of a middle-income country.âThe OECD predicted Chinaâs consumer inflation will ease to 2.4 per cent in 2014 from 2.5 per cent this year.The volume of Chinaâs exports of goods and services will grow 6.8 per cent in 2014, easing from 8.8 per cent this year, while import growth could slow to 9.2 per cent from 9.8 per cent.Expansion in IndiaElsewhere, the OECD sees Indiaâs economy expanding 3.4 per cent this year and 5.1 per cent in 2014, down from 5.7 per cent and 6.6 per cent previously.âMost of the emerging economies have underlying fragilities that mean they cannot continue growing as they used to,â said Padoan.âThey used to be an important support engine for global growth in bad times. Now the reverse is true and advanced economies canât be said to be in very good times again.â
