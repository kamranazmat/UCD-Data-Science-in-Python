You donât need to value your property,âit said in a statement.âRevenue will not be writing to you if you paid your 2013 LPT by phased payment method (direct debit or deduction at source from your salary, occupational pension or certain Government payments). Your phased payment method will continue to apply in 2014 and you donât need to contact Revenue.âSimilarly, Revenue will not be writing to you if you claimed a full deferral or were exempt as the deferral or exemption carries forward to 2014.âFurther details for the forthcoming year and details on how to change payment methods can be found at revenue.ie.Latest Economy
