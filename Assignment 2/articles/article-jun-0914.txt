I consider myself very fortunate to have been able to donate a kidney to Alison as for some families living donation might not be an option.âShe wants the general public to support European Day for Organ Donation by having a discussion with their loved ones about organ donation.Her sister Alison, a media student, said âthe operation has been a great success and as Melissa was a perfect match the prospect of my new kidney lasting for longer is much greater. I will always be grateful to the families of the deceased donors for my previous two kidney transplants which gave me a better quality of life when I was younger.âShe encouraged people to carry an organ donor card and be aware of the immense difference a transplant can make to all those people with organ failure.There are more than 650 people in Ireland awaiting organ transplants including heart, lung, liver, kidney and pancreas.Last year Alison was declared âBest Female Athlete on Dialysisâ for demonstrating great spirit and determination at the European Transplant and Dialysis Games where she secured three medals.Last year 78 donors helped 206 people receive organ transplants, 10 of whom received heart transplants at the Mater hospital in Dublin.For organ donor cards freetext the word DONOR to 50050 or Locall 1890-543639 or log on to ika.ie
