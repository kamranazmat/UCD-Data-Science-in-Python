Net voted expenditure was â¬35.3 billion, or â¬844 million (2.3 per cent) below target.Income tax was 3 per cent down on a monthly target of â¬1.36 billion, with the shortfall being attributed to weak DIRT, which is a tax on savings.Overall, income tax of â¬12.13 billion was collected in the first ten months of the year, compared to an expected â¬12.25 billion.Excise duties were â¬3.85 billion, which was 1.3 per cent behind target, at the end of October. However they recorded a surplus against target for October of â¬110 million.
