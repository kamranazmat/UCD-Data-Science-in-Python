Slowing of purchases in December feasibleThe rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee made no changes to policy at its October meeting, keeping its asset purchases steady at $85 billion a month, but the statement implied it did not see a lot of damage from the government shutdown earlier this monthThe US Federal Reserve yesterday said the worldâs largest economy was still expanding at a moderate pace, suggesting a slowing of asset purchases in December or January was still a possibility.The rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee made no changes to policy at its October meeting, keeping its asset purchases steady at $85 billion a month, but the statement implied it did not see a lot of damage from the government shutdown earlier this month.Although markets have assumed the Fed will not âtaperâ its asset purchases until March, the statement implied it could still slow the programme earlier than that â perhaps as early as its December meeting â if the economic data justified it.The Fed surprised markets in September by choosing to keep purchases on hold. That prompted a global rally in risky assets and big fall in market interest rates, which had risen after Fed communications in June and July suggested it was close to a taper.Scrambled dataCombined with the effects of the shutdown â which has scrambled the data for October â  markets have assumed the September decision meant the Fed was automatically on hold for some months. But Octoberâs statement suggests that is not necessarily correct.In the most notable change in the statement, the Fed eliminated a sentence from September saying that tighter financial conditions â Fed code for higher market interest rates â could lead to a slower improvement in the economy. Scrapping the sentence suggests it is now comfortable with interest rates.It also kept Septemberâs language that the economy was expanding at a âmoderateâ pace, choosing not to downgrade it to âmodestâ, although it noted the housing sector had slowed somewhat in recent months.However, the Fed pointedly said that its judgment was based on âavailable dataâ, indicating that it could yet change as more detailed information for October becomes available.The Fed board  voted for the decision by a majority of 9-1. Esther George , the president of the Kansas City Fed, dissented because she was concerned about the risk of future economic and financial imbalances.  â
