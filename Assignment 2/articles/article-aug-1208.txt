Statins are one of the most commonly prescribed classes of drugs.

In fact, longer-term statin use was associated with protection from dementia.âThe researchers conducted two different analyses. One looked at the impact of short term statin use on brain function, while the other examined how taking the drugs long term related to Alzheimerâs disease or vascular dementia.The findings are published online in the journal Mayo Clinic Proceedings.Co-author Dr Raoul Manalac , also from Johns Hopkins Medicine, said: âOur goal was to provide clarity on this issue based on the best available evidence.âWe looked at high-quality, randomised controlled trials and prospective studies that included more than 23,000 men and women with no prior history of cognitive problems. The participants in those studies were followed for up to 25 years.âStatins lower levels of âbadâ cholesterol, or low-density lipoprotein (LDL) in the blood.LDL contributes to the build up of plaque deposits that narrow blood vessels in the brain as well as the heart.The drugs have been shown to reduce inflammation within blood vessels and the risk of stroke-inducing blood clots. - Press Association
