Photograph: Jon Nazca / Online NewsRatings agency Standard & Poorâs agency cut the Netherlandsâ credit rating on yesterday, reducing the euro zone club of full triple-A nations to just three, while rewarding Spain for efforts to reform its public finances.S&P lowered the Netherlands , which is suffering from an anaemic economy, slumping house prices and falling consumer confidence, to AA+ from AAA. This left Germany , Luxembourg and Finland as the only members of the 17-nation euro zone with the top rating from all three leading credit agencies.However, it raised the outlook for Spanish debt to stable from negative and upgraded bailed-out Cyprus , highlighting diverging fortunes within the common currency bloc.The credit rating agency said it still rated Spanish sovereign debt at triple B minus â only one notch above junk â but that there was now a much smaller chance of a further downgrade in the next two years.âWe see improvement in Spainâs external position as economic growth gradually resumes,â said an S&P statement.The change comes weeks after Fitch , another credit rating agency, made a similar move, shifting Spainâs credit outlook from ânegativeâ to âstableâ, and adding that the economy was now on a âsurer footingâ.Both actions reflect growing confidence among analysts and investors that Spain is on a path of slow but stable economic recovery, thanks to a surge in exports and the gradual restoration of competitiveness in the private sector after years of wage restraint and job losses.S&P said the Dutch decision was due to a worsening of growth prospects. âThe real GDP per capita trend growth rate is persistently lower than that of peers at similarly high levels of economic development,â the agency said, while affirming the Netherlandsâ short-term debt rating at A-1+.â Online News / The Financial Times Limited 2013
