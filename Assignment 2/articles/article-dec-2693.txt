In around a quarter of deaths, the illness or death of a relative or friend was noted.The academics described their study as the âfirst ever detailed analysis of deaths by suicide in Northern Ireland from 1995â that draws on data from the Northern Ireland coronersâ files.The findings show that men remain three times more likely to take their own lives than women. Suicide rates are similar across all the middle age cohorts with rising rates among the over 70s. More than two thirds (67 per cent) of those who died by suicide had a recorded mental illness while 59 per cent had a recorded physical illness.âThis study provides us with the most detailed information to date, upon which to base future suicide prevention initiatives in Northern Ireland,â said Prof OâNeill from the Bamford Centre for Mental Health and Well-being at the Universityâs Magee campus in Derry and of the Irish Association of Suicidology .âWe need to find ways of helping people of all ages, and men in particular, to seek help and support for mental health problems during stressful life events,â she added.âSuicide prevention is not simply a matter for health care providers. Politicians and policy makers all need to remain cognisant of the impact of their social policies on mental health and suicide. Suicide prevention is everyoneâs responsibility,â  Prof OâNeill said.
