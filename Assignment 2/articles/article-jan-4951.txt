The protection of taxpayers from costly bank bailouts is being described as a âbinding preconditionâ for the SPD in these talks.As the negotiation continues, the SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung reported yesterday that the SPD sees no circumstances in which it would support direct ESM aid to Irelandâs banks.SPD finance spokesman Carsten Schneider was quoted saying such a programme would be possible only if Dublin granted two concessions on business taxation.Tax plansIreland would be obliged first to drop its opposition to a stalled European plan to tax financial transactions.Ireland would also be obliged to increase the 12.5 per cent corporate tax rate, something the Coalition has vowed not to do. There was no comment last evening from the spokesman for the Government, which expects a smooth exit from the EU/IMF bailout in December.In German official circles right now, the clear sense remains that Ireland is not a cause for any concern and that the likely return to private bond markets demonstrates that the State has no need for any more debt relief.An Irish source said the Government would never comment on reports on coalition talks in any other country. It is understood, however, that the Government sees no erosion of Dr Merkelâs pledge one year ago to treat Irelandâs banking problem as a âspecial caseâ.
