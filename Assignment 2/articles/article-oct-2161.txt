Augmentin is prescribed for chest infections, including bronchitis and pneumonia.There will be a shortage of the widely used antibiotic Augmentin in Ireland from next month, according to the Department of Health .The department said a shortage of the lower strength 375mg tablet was expected in a couple of weeks. A shortage of the higher strength 625mg tablet is being forecast from January.Augmentin is prescribed for chest infections, including bronchitis and pneumonia. The HSE said that while there appeared to be a supply issue in relation to Augmentin and similar generics, it did not see this as something which should be a cause of concern amongst patients.In response to a DÃ¡il question , Minister of State at the Department of Health Alex White said the shortages were due to a combination of manufacturing problems at two UK sites of manufacturer GlaxosmithKline, coupled with an increase in demand.Mr White said he expected the shortage to last until at least September next year.The Minister said the HSE and the Irish Medicines Board were trying to identify alternative sources of supply, including from the manufacturer of a generic version of the product.He said the HSE was also working with doctors to develop prescribing guidelines for alternative treatment regimes if Augmentin is not available.Mr White said the issue would evolve over the coming months and said it was extremely important all stakeholders work together âto ensure that there is no panic buying which would accelerate the problemâ.In a statement, the HSE confirmed it had  received notification from GlaxoSmithKline  of âan international long-term problem with availability of co-amoxiclav (Augmentin) 250mg/125mg (375mg) tabs and 500mg/125mg (625mg) tabsâ.It said it was working with the Department of Health, the Irish Medicines Board and the Irish College of General Practitioners.âWhile there appears to be a supply issue in relation to Augmentin and similar generics we do not see this as something which should be a cause of concern amongst patients,â the executive said in a statement.âThe IMB has been engaging with Irish manufacturers of co-amoxiclav to see if products manufactured for other markets can be made available on the Irish market or indeed if products manufactured outside of Ireland could also be made available for the Irish market.âThe HSE said that although co -amoxiclav was a commonly prescribed antimicrobial in primary care, it was ârarely recommended as the first choice antibioticâ.âThere are a range of alternative and less expensive forms of antibiotic used which are more appropriate as the first line of defense in situations where Augmentin is prescribed.âIt said this was also  an opportunity to emphasise to prescribers that antiobiotics may not be an appropriate treatment,  depending on the infection - for example in the case of  viral infections.Based on current stock, the Irish market can be supplied with Augmentin 625mg tablets until the end of November, and with 375mg tablets until the end of January..
