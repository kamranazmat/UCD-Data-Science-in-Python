Estimate for growth next year trimmed to  1.8 per centGermanyâs leading economic institutes halved their 2013 growth forecast for Europeâs largest economy to 0.4 per cent today, citing a significant downturn in industrial production during the winter.The institutes, whose analysis flows into the German governmentâs own economic forecasts, also trimmed their estimate for growth next year to 1.8 per cent, down from the 1.9 per cent they had predicted in April.âThe German economy is on the cusp of an upturn which will be driven by domestic demand,â they said in a statement.Exports will increase modestly thanks to stronger global growth while imports will get a big boost from domestic demand, meaning that foreign trade will probably drag on growth, they added.
