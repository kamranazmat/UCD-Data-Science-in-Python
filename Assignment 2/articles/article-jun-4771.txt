Photograph: Ralph Orlowski/Online NewsThe European Central Bank has dismissed the idea of no-strings-attached funding to ease Irelandâs return to financial markets.ECB executive board member JÃ¶rg Asmussen said yesterday that any further assistance to Ireland , if granted, would come with conditions imposed by the ESM bailout fund.âIt could well be that the Irish will find a solution on their own,â he told the BÃ¶rsenzeitung financial daily.Confirming he had read recent comments by Minister for Finance Michael Noonan about the possibility of a â¬10 billion precautionary credit line from the bailout fund, Mr Asmussen added: âHe knows that a precautionary ESM programme comes with conditions.âMr Asmussen said Ireland would not automatically qualify for the ECBâs OMT bond-buying programme â another proposed financial backstop to reassure investors ahead of Irelandâs return to markets.The ECB official said the rules for activating the as-yet untouched OMT programme were known: a country needs to be an ESM programme country with IMF involvement.âThis can also be a precautionary programme with the possibility of primary market purchases by the ESM,â he said, âbut particularly important, and weâve always repeated this, is that a country under an EFSF or ESM programme has to be in a position to win full access to capital markets.âThe ECB would not accept short-term debt obligations, so-called treasury bills (T-bills) as proof of financing.Capital marketsâOMT is a finance market instrument, not a replacement for the lack of access to capital markets.âAsked whether OMT could be employed to assist capital market returns of programme countries, Mr Asmussen said the bankâs governing council would âdecide on a case-by-case basisâ.Last week ECB president Mario Draghi said a decision on Irelandâs request would be taken âin due timeâ and would be decided by euro zone finance ministers.
