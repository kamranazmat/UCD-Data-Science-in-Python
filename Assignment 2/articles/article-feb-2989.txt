This resulted in a total pay package of more than â¬240,000These unauthorised allowances are a breach of public sector pay policy.The Friends and Supporters of the Remedial Clinic , a separate company linked to the clinic, generates funds from a lottery administered by the Care Trust.Latest figures show this company had a total of â¬14 million in funds at the end of 2011, at a time when the clinic has been accused of cutting services to vulnerable children and adults.
