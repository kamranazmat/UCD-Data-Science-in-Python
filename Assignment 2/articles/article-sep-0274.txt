HSE concerned at upsurge in gonorrhoea casesPublic health director says forms of infection may become untreatable in futureFalse-colour transmission electron micrograph of Neisseria gonorrhoeae (gonococcus), the species of bacteria causing the sexually- transmitted infection gonorrhoea.The growing number of people being diagnosed with the sexually transmitted infection gonorrhoea in the State is a âcause for concernâ, the HSE has said.A total of 1,077 cases have been notified to date this year, compared to 1,110 for the whole of 2012.The HSE said the âmagnitude of the increaseâ in the Dublin , Wicklow and Kildare region was a particular worry with 817 cases diagnosed last year - 33 per cent more than in 2011.  A similar trend is occurring in the UK.The development has prompted the HSE to establish a âan outbreak control teamâ which carried out âenhanced surveillance on all gonorrhoea cases notified during the first three months of 2013 in the East and South-East areasâ.It found that young heterosexuals and men who have sex with men were the two groups most at risk. The HSE said the proportion of cases seen in heterosexuals was âquite high at 44 per centâ of the totalâ. An information campaign targetting the groups is being run by the HSE over the coming weeks.âThis upsurge in gonorrhoea is a cause of concern, as untreated or inadequately treated gonorrhoea may lead to severe complications including infertility in men and women,â HSE East director of public health Dr Margaret Fitzgerald said.She said âemerging antimicrobial resistanceâ to gonorrhoea was a major concern and that it was possible some forms of the infection âmay become untreatable in the near futureâ.Dr Fitzgerald said some 50 per cent of women and 10 per cent of men with urogenital gonorrhoea may not be aware they have the infection.Unsafe sexual behaviour was a significant driver of the increase in cases of gonorrhoea and other STIs, the HSE said.On its website, the Health Surveillance Protection Centre recommends abstinence, a mutually monogamous relationship with an uninfected person and correct use of condoms as ways of avoiding gonorrhoea.
