But we have no other income, and no private insurance,â she said yesterday.Tom Fleming , the Kerry South Independent TD who has been trying to fight the coupleâs case, said yesterday: âShe has recurring cancer. Her husband is nearly 70. Sheâs a typical example of what I and other TDs are dealing with since the â¬20 million cut to the medical card budget.âVery insensitiveââIt is all very insensitive. I have seen the upset, the stress and the whole worry that is descending on vulnerable people.âIt is very hard to comprehend how a modern civilised society can look at accounts rather than at individual people. There seems to be no discretion.â
