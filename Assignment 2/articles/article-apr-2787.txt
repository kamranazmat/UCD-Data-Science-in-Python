Average jobs growth for the past three months is 193,000.Novemberâs payrolls data creates a close call for the Fed at its December meeting: they are not the kind of outstanding figure that would make âtaperingâ an easy decision but add to growing evidence of momentum in the economy.The Fed is paying close attention to Novemberâs jobs data after the October report was distorted by a three-week government shutdown. Job gains were spread across the economy, with the manufacturing sector adding 27,000 jobs, 17,000 new positions in construction, 22,300 in retail, 30,500 in transport, and 29,600 in healthcare. â
