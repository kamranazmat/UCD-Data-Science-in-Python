The report found that 22 per cent of nine year olds live in a home where people smoke in the same room as them.Disadvantaged children are more likely to live in households with smoking adults and are at greater risk of exposure to second-hand smoke.According to the report nine-year-old children in the Republic living in the lowest income families are twice as likely to be exposed to smoking than children in the highest income families.Having a mother who smoked was associated with an increased risk of respiratory illnesses and ear infections in the first nine months of life.Dr Helen McAvoy of the IPH said many trends identified in the report were encouraging.âThe reportâs findings demonstrate the return from the introduction of broad-ranging tobacco control measures such as smoke-free workplaces, regulation of vending machines and pack sizes, price increases and removal of point of sale displays in retail outlets,â she said.âHowever, the burden of harm associated with smoking falls heavily on the most disadvantaged children.She said children were uniquely susceptible to tobacco marketing and branding.The report highlights the importance of continuing efforts to restrict access and appeal of tobacco products to young people and stresses the importance of stop smoking initiatives within maternity, child and family policies and services, particularly in disadvantaged areas.It draws on a range of data sources in the Republic and from Northern Ireland including Growing Up in Ireland, the national longitudinal study of children; research from the Coombe; and analysis of the Health Behaviour in School-aged Child Survey (HSBC).The publication was welcomed by the Minister for Health James Reilly and his counterpart in the North Edwin Poots.
