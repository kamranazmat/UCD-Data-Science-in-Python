Photograph: Francois Lenoir/Online NewsEuropean Union finance ministers struggled to advance a bank-failure plan for the euro area today, hampered by the interregnum in Berlin and persistent divisions on basic points.Ministers will be pressed to meet a year-end deadline to broker an accord after cutting short talks in Brussels today.The blocâs 28 nations are split on who should be the ultimate decision-maker in the planned Single Resolution Mechanism, whether it should be backed by a central fund and which banks should be covered.Germany reiterated its opposition to key planks of the blueprint proposed by the European Commission .Todayâs discussion âproved that today we still do not have agreement, so it was absolutely senseless to sit overnight, because thereâs still no way to get this final agreement,â said finance minister Rimantas Sadzius of Lithuania , which holds the EUâs rotating presidency.The Single Resolution Mechanism is part of a euro-area effort to break the financial links between sovereigns and banks by centralizing oversight and crisis management of failing lenders.The proposal, presented in July by Michel Barnier , the EUâs financial services chief, initially met with a barrage of complaints from governments.EU leaders nevertheless reaffirmed last month that nations should agree on a common stance by the end of this year and called the plan is an essential complement to European Central Bank supervision of euro-area lenders, which begins in a year.Common fundGerman finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble called on his colleagues to rein in their ambitions for the SRM, including the proposed central fund.He has said Mr  Barnierâs centralized blueprint should be scrapped in favour of a network of national authorities without a common fund, on the basis that further steps can only be taken once changes are made to the EUâs basic treaties.Todayâs debate âshowed that of course we canât get a perfect solution on the basis of current treaties,â Mr Schaeuble said.He noted a âdeepened understandingâ among his colleagues that a sound legal basis for any resolution system âis necessary not only from a German point of view.âGerman chancellor Angela Merkelâs Christian Democratic bloc is in talks with the Social Democrats to form a so-called grand coalition government, almost two months after Ms Merkelâs party won the largest share of the vote in parliamentary elections.âNo governmentââAs long as there is no government in Germany I donât see progress,â Dutch finance minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem said.The barriers in the way of making progress at todayâs gathering led Mr Sadzius to scale back plans for a series of one- on-one meetings with finance ministers, shortening the meeting by several hours. A planned dinner was also cancelled.Mr Sadzius said that he would seek a political deal on the plans at the ministersâ next meeting on December 10th.Minister for Finance Michael Noonan raised the prospect that finance ministers may have to convene again after that meeting to get a deal.âIt seemed to me that thereâs a lot of goodwill to get decisions taken in December, and itâll be up now to the Lithuanian presidency to do that at the regular meeting or to do it at a special meeting,â Mr Noonan said..
