Photograph: Bryan OâBrienOur Ladyâs Childrenâs Hospital in Crumlin has reiterated its âcategoricalâ support for locating the new national childrenâs hospital at St Jamesâs Hospital.Chief executive Lorcan Birthistle said the hospital informed the Government in April last year that its board unanimously supported the location of the new hospital on the St Jamesâs campus and âthis position remains unchangedâ.Mr Birthistle was responding to recent media coverage of the issue, including a call by An Taisce to extend the campus of St Jamesâs to include the Coombe Womenâs Hospital and to relocate the project from St Jamesâs to land adjacent to the Coombe.This would mean the hospital was co-located with a childrenâs hospital, in line with best international practice.Dr Orla Franklin , a consultant paediatric cardiologist at Crumlin, has also expressed reservation about the failure to co-locate the childrenâs hospital with a maternity hospital, given the need for very sick newborns to receive immediate treatment in a childrenâs hospital.Mr Birthistle said in a statement issued this morning: âWe look forward to working with the Childrenâs Hospital Group Board and the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board in developing this very important project on the St Jamesâs campus.â
