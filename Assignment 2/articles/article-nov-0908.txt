Photograph: Frank Miller/The Online NewsCigarette breaks by the Belfield lake are one step closer to ending at University College Dublin where students have voted in favour of a smoke-free campus.The vote result means that the UCD Studentsâ Union (UCDSU) will support a proposal by the universityâs health promotion committee to make the campus smoke free.The result means that UCDâs health committee will now begin consulting with both academic and administrative staff representatives on the proposal, a university spokesman said.However the result does not necessarily mean that the 320-acre south Dublin campus will become smoke-free .UCDSU president MÃ­cheÃ¡l Gallagher said when the proposal was put to the universityâs health promotion committee in March last they felt it âwould be necessary to have a referendum on this issue to gauge the levels of support for the issueâ. Mr Gallagher is a member of the health committee.âThe result today shows studentsâ engagement with the democratic process. They have endorsed the proposal for a smoke free campus. UCD students have a proud tradition of being on the cutting edge of health promotion initiatives,â Mr Gallagher said .Students taking part in the referendum voted 55 per cent in favour of a smoke-free campus. Over 2,500 votes were cast in the poll held by UCD Studentsâ Union out of some 30,000 students.The voting took place on Tuesday and Wednesday of this week on the following proposal: âThis union supports the smoke free campus initiative, as proposed by the UCD Health Promotion Committee.âAnti-smoking lobby group Ash Ireland has been campaiging to encourage third-level institutions to ban smoking on college campuses across the State. Such on-campus tobacco bans have been introduced at many universities in the United States.The Health Service Executive has introduced a smoke-free campus policy at many hospitals and has said all HSE campuses will become tobacco-free by 2015.Last year independent senator John Crown failed in his bid to make Leinster House grounds the first smoke-free parliament in the world.
