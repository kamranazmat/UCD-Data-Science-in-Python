Hospital board acknowledges allowance funded from âon-site commercial activitiesâColin GleesonThe board of Our Ladyâs Childrenâs Hospital, Crumlin last night stated its intention to âpursue directlyâ the matter of a pay rise for the hospitalâs chief executive with the HSE.The hospitalâs chief executive is Lorcan Birthistle who, according to files at the Department of Health, receives total remuneration of â¬140,808. This includes a top-up of â¬30,000 from a âprivately funded allowanceâ.Mr Birthistleâs salary is among the lowest paid to the countryâs hospital chief executives, and last week councillor Ruairi McGinley â who is a board member â said he was certain ââ¬110,000 is not an appropriate salary for a chief executive of a national childrenâs hospitalâ.He said no one in the public service should earn more than the Taoiseachâs salary of â¬185,000 and added that the salary of the chief executive at Crumlin hospital was âat the lowest end of any of the numbers that have appearedâ.âAppropriate renumerationâA statement released following a meeting of the hospital board last night said it has previously attempted to secure the approval of the health authorities for âan appropriate remuneration levelâ for the chief executive.âThe board believes this can now be achieved in accordance with the recommendations of the HSE Internal Audit Report and this will be pursued directly with the HSE,â the statement said.The issue of top-ups for executives was the chief matter on the agenda at the meeting of the hospitalâs board which also acknowledged for the first time that Mr Birthistleâs salary includes âan allowance funded from on-site commercial activitiesâ.âThe contracted remuneration of the chief executive has full board approval since his appointment and is fully compliant with PAYE and other statutory deductions.â
