Photograph: The Online NewsThe Government is ignoring Irelandâs mid-size companies in favour of an enterprise policy aimed at supporting multinationals and start-ups, Irish Stock Exchange (ISE) chief executive Deirdre Somers has said.Speaking at a Funding for Growth conference in Dublin, Ms Somers said Ireland needed a more balanced enterprise policy to enable the growth of a strong indigenous enterprise sector.âDeveloping more home-grown success stories, which are capable of earning money abroad and spending it on creating jobs at home, can make a major and sustainable contribution to the economic and social life of this country.âShe said the Government should stop taxing investment in Ireland and Irish companies by charging stamp duty on investors who buy shares.âThe current taxation of share options makes it hugely unattractive for entrepreneurs to share in the benefits of growing their business to scale. A profound rethink about how we tax capital, share options and exits is necessary.âMs Somers said Irelandâs low corporation tax was not enough to deliver successful mid-market companies (those with annual turnover of more than â¬20 million and profits of more than â¬3 million), adding that a change in policy was needed.Department of Finance secretary general John Moran told the conference, organised by the ISE, that there needed to be a change in the culture âright through schools and universityâ for people to have the belief they could set up a company and have it succeed, IPO and go global.He said that private savers also needed to invest in companies or the Government would run out of resources. âThe Government canât fund everythingâ¦domestic savings should be driving a lot of this.âOpenet founder and chief technology officer Joe Hogan said Ireland needed to have incentives for companies to become mid-sized and not sell out too early/at the first offer.âCompensation drives behaviourâ¦there needs to be incentives to invest.â
