The current charge is â¬ 75 per night. Aviva said the new charge âdirectly increases the cost of providing cover for our membersâ.Its chief executive Alison Burns claimed the company was âdeeply conscious of the struggle our customers face to maintain their health coverâ and she said it had taken the decision not to increase the price of some of its entry level plans.âThose due to renew in January and February already face premium increases as a result of the governmentâs decision to reduce tax relief. With this in mind, we have held our increase to the absolute minimum of an average of 5.2 per cent.âShe added that Aviva would have to keep premium prices under review over the coming months.âRecent government policy changes have severely disrupted the health insurance market and their impact on customer behaviour remains to be seen. Our first obligation as a responsible regulated insurer is to make sure we are in a position to pay the claims of our customers when they get sick,â she stressed..
