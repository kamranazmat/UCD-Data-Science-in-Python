He was appointed to the board of NAMA by the Minister for Finance in March 2012 for a five-year term and was appointed NAMAâs head of asset management in April 2012.Brendan McDonagh, chief executive of NAMA, said that Mr Mulcachy was a âpivotalâ presence at the property agency, and it would have been âvery much more difficult to deal with the scale of the challenge that we faced four years ago without the undoubted expertise of John who was, and is, widely respected in the property businessâ.In 2012, some 10 per cent of the agencyâs workforce left, and it was recently disclosed that staff joining NAMA will now be subject to six month notice periods to prevent any potential conflicts of interest arising when they choose to leave the agency.Latest Economy
