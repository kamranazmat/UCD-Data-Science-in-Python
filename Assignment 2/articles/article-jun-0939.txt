Charity linked to clinic has â¬14 million  at a time of  cuts to services,  committee hearsIndependent TD Shane Ross said it appeared  the CRC had access to large sums of money when it was cutting services. Photograph: Bryan OâBrienThe Health Service Executive has been asked to investigate whether funding from a charitable organisation linked to the Central Remedial Clinic (CRC) was used to fund unauthorised payments to senior staff.At the DÃ¡il Public Accounts Committee yesterday, it emerged that a company called the Friends and Supporters of the Central Remedial Clinic had â¬14 million in funds at the end of 2011. This company, listed as a charity, also received National Lottery funding of almost â¬4 million between 2010 and 2011.Allowance of â¬19,016This comprised a HSE-funded salary of â¬106,900, a CRC-funded salary of â¬116,949 and a separate CRC-funded allowance of â¬19,016. In addition, 25 per cent of the CRC salary was paid into a private pension fund.Unauthorised private allowances are a breach of public sector pay policy.In response, HSE director general Tony OâBrien said the figures seemed âstrangeâ and agreed questions needed to be asked. He also pointed out that while in one year it received Lottery funding of â¬2 million, at the end of that year the charity had a supply of nearly the same amount. âClearly, there are questions to be asked and answered over that,â he said.The HSE chief pledged to investigate the issue on behalf of the committee, but added the HSEâs legal relationship was with the CRC and not with the parents and friends organisation. He added, however, he was âcautious to form an opinionâ until there was greater clarity over whether these funds were available to the CRC and what the aims and objectives of the charitable body were.The clinic â which is a national centre for the care, treatment and development of children and adults with physical disabilities â was unavailable for comment last night.It did issue a statement to The Online News last week in relation to queries over pay for senior staff. It said figures contained in a HSE internal audit were âhistoricâ and did not provide a current picture of staff remuneration at the Central Remedial Clinic.âPrivate matterââThe personal salary levels of individual staff within the Central Remedial Clinic is a matter reserved, under the Central Remedial Clinicâs corporate governance, for the board of the CRC and as such is a private matter between the clinic and its staff,â it said.At the committee meeting yesterday, Labour TD Robert Dowds , a former employee of a school under the auspices of the CRC, said he was dismayed to learn that funds appeared to have been used to top-up senior salaries at a time of cut-backs to the organisation.
