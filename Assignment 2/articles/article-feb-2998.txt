With just a hint of mischievousness, the organisers called it the âGlobalâ Cork Economic Forum. They must have forgotten to add a âBoyâ at the end.The website for Rebel Week also contains a self-deprecating nod to that chippy Second City Syndrome that sometimes afflicts the lovely Leesiders: a red banner proclaiming the Peopleâs Republic of Cork is emblazoned across the homepage. All in good spirits, of course.The event was chaired by John Mullins while the MC was broadcaster Matt Cooper, both well-known sons of Cork. Among the speakers were some of the best-known business figures in the State: Vodafone boss Anne OâLeary, Independent News & Media chairman Leslie Buckley , Tesco Ireland director Tony Keohane , and Patrick Coveney , the chief executive of Greencore .Mullins told me that the main message from the morning session was that Cork âneeds to understand that it is the second city, but that this has its advantagesâ when looking for investment. The need for an international fibre link into Cork was also a hot topic.It was suggested, tongue in cheek, by some panel members that a âred cardâ be issued to anyone who mentioned Dublin during the debates.Incidentally, Cork Airport is one of the Rebel Week sponsors. Now might not be a good time to mention that it is actually owned by the Dublin Airport Authority . Or that Coveney was last yearâs president of the Dublin Chamber of Commerce..
