A lot of young women donât feel they have the power to make their own decisions.âThere is a lack of an information âbridgeâ between being a child female and an adult woman, says Terri Levine (23).âThe information needs to be accessible in a way that young women can get it without risking feeling embarrassed or silly for not knowing everything already.âHealth informationAnd young women do have particular needs for health information, says Ms Kelly. âOf course, young men have health issues, but for young women health is often seen in negative terms, as embarrassing or a crisis. Responsibility is thrust on women in a way itâs not on men, but without the information.âWe want to provide the information and encourage young women to look for it, to discuss their health and their rights and in a way that itâs not taboo and itâs not embarrassing.âAmong the health issues addressed in the Y-factor leaflets and sites are eating disorders, bullying, sexual assault, and contraception.
