Four of the five economists also attacked as âfrivolousâ Social Democrat (SPD) demands for an â¬8.50 statutory minimum wage as a condition for joining a new coalition. The economists warned the move risked destroying jobs, particularly in eastern Germany.DissensionEconomist Peter Bofinger said â¬8.50 was manageable as a minimum wage, however, pointing out that Germany is one of the last western countries not to have one.âThere are many studies for Germany which show there would be no effect on the labour market,â he said.The economists backed Berlinâs strategy for a strict âliability cascadeâ to ensure creditors and owners of failing banks are tapped first for funding, then national governments and, only in the medium or long-term, European funds.If the looming European bank stress test reveal gaps in bank finances, they said, the ESM fund should only be tapped as a last resort, with national governments acting as guarantors. âWe are against a direct recapitalisation of banks via the ESM and we think, in the medium to long term, we wonât have the conditions for this,â said Prof Claudia Buch.The economists forecast a brightening in Germanyâs economic prospects next year: 1.6 per cent after growth of just 0.4 per cent this year.
