We now are at a juncture where exchange of information is the rule and bank secrecy for tax purposes is no longer acceptable. And Ireland has played a key role.âIreland has always been keen on transparency; there is no such thing as an opaque system in Ireland.âEarlier this year the OECD reported to the G20 on the issue of base erosion and profit shifting, the legacy of which has been manifest in controversies involving multinationals paying little in tax despite reaping considerable profits.âSocial contractâOECD policy is directed toward the elimination of both double taxation and double non-taxation, arising out of companies basing themselves across jurisdictions and ultimately taking advantage of a complex web of tax laws.âI think the Irish people have made it clear that they are a sovereign people and 12.5 per cent is part of that social contract and itâs part of your sovereignty,â he said.Meanwhile, the secretary general at the Department of Finance John Moran , outlined the Governmentâs belief that restructuring the âhugely flawedâ tax system in Ireland was key to sustaining economic growth as well as to revenue raising.
