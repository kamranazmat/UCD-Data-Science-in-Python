The father of a child receiving care from the Central Remedial Clinic has described his anger at revelations that money from a company which fundraises on behalf of the clinic went towards executivesâ payThe father of a child receiving care from the Central Remedial Clinic has described his anger at revelations that money from a company which fundraises on behalf of the clinic went towards executivesâ pay.Joe Watson from Swords, whose nine-year-old son has attended the clinic since he was six months old, said he was âshocked, disgusted and enragedâ by the revelations.He made his comments after it emerged that a charitable company, Friends and Supporters of the Remedial Clinic, which generates funds from a lottery, were used to top up the salaries of senior staff at a time when the organisation was cutting services for adults and children with disabilities.FundraisingMr Watson, who spoke to The Online News yesterday having appeared on Today with SeÃ¡n OâRourke on RTÃ Radio One earlier in the day, said he had been involved in numerous fundraising activities on behalf of the CRC.These included cake sales, bag-packing, bucket collections and a poker night, âsmall things but they all added upâ.âAnd it was people giving up their free time to help me out in order to help the CRC out in order to help my son out . . . had I have known I certainly wouldnât have done itâ.Mr Watson emphasised that he âcould not faultâ the treatment his son had received at the clinic.âWithout the CRC my son wouldnât be the person he is today . . . [the staff], theyâre the front line â they do their job and they go the extra mile without a shadow of doubt,â he said, adding that it was âupper managementâ who had benefited.âThese are recessionary times that people are living in day to day â for them to hear about these astronomical sums of money which are coming from fundraising, it doesnât sit well with anyone.â
