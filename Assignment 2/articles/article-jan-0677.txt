In Britain, dementia is the most feared health condition among people aged over 55.

Itâs vital that the World Health Organization makes dementia a priority, so the world is ready to face this condition.âAlzheimerâs, the most common form of dementia, is a fatal brain disease that has no cure and few effective treatments.Like other forms of the disorder, it affects patientsâ memory, thinking and behaviour and is an increasingly overwhelming burden on societies and economies. While there are a few drugs that can ease some symptoms in some people, there is no cure.Even now, the global cost of dementia care is more than $600 billon (â¬441 billion), or around 1.0 per cent of global gross domestic product (GDP), and that will only increase, the ADI says.In a policy report published along with the new data, Martin Prince , a professor at Kingâs College Londonâs Institute of Psychiatry, said âmost governments are woefully unprepared for the dementia epidemicâ. His report said only 13 countries have national dementia plans.âThis is a global problem that is increasingly impacting on developing countries with limited resources and little time to develop comprehensive systems of social protection, health and social care,â Prof Prince said in a statement.Leaders from the Group of Eight (G8) industrialised countries are due to meet in London next week for a special summit on dementia - a condition that includes Alzheimerâs, vascular dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), fronto-temporal dementia and many other causes of cognitive decline.In Britain, dementia is the most feared health condition among people aged over 55 and costs the economy Â£23 billion  (â¬27.7 billion) a year - more than cancer, stroke or heart disease combined.British prime minister David Cameron , who will host the summit, has committed to spending Â£66 million  on dementia research by 2015. Campaigners welcome the investment, but also say it is a fraction - one eighth - of what is spent on cancer research in Britain.Experts on neurological conditions, research campaigners and charities say they are determined the summit should not be just a talking shop, but should see leaders committing to dramatically increased funds for research and drug development in dementia, and to giving it greater political attention.âLack of funding means dementia research is falling behind other conditions,â said Jeremy Hughes , chief executive of the Alzheimerâs Society. âThe G8 is our once-in-a-generation chance to conquer this condition and we must see meaningful action after the talking is over.â - Online News
