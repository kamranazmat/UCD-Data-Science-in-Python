New concerns over childrenâs hospital siteAn Taisce calls for  site to be moved from St Jamesâs   Hospital to land  near CoombeSt Jamesâs Hospital in Dublin. An Taisce says the âapparent failureâ to co-locate the proposed new national childrenâs hospital  with a maternity hospital, as recommended in a number of expert reports, âsends alarm bells ringingâ.

Project splitting would, in turn, fall foul of basic requirements set out in Irish and European planning law, bringing about a repeat of the previous delay all over again.âAn Taisce says Mr Kenny can âsteer the project on to the right courseâ by extending the Governmentâs decision of last November to the entire Dublin Midlands hospital group which includes St Jamesâs and the Coombe and moving the project to a 15-acre site adjacent to the Coombe.It says this land, which is controlled by Nama and Dublin City Council , offers outstanding benefits for co-locating with the maternity hospital in the Coombe.The land is larger than the site available at St Jamesâs, has more access points and would allow for vital space to be preserved at St Jamesâs for the expansion of cancer facilities there, Mr Nix argues.âUnpardonableââIt would be unpardonable to find out in five or 10 yearsâ time that there remained insufficient space left for a maternity hospital; hence the need to right the course now, rather than run a clear risk.âThe new hospital will bring together the three existing Dublin childrenâs hospitals at Crumlin, Tallaght and Temple Street. Eilish Hardiman started work as chief executive of the Childrenâs Hospital Group on Friday and work has started to decant existing activities on the site at the west end of St Jamesâs in order to make way for the new building.
