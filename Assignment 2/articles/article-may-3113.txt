Photograph: Francois Lenoir /Online NewsMinister for Finance Michael Noonan said he hopes Moodyâs rating agency will raise the Irelandâs credit rating from non-investment grade as the country exits its bailout program and plans debt sales.âWeâre hopeful that Moodyâs will have another look at us early in the New Year,â Mr Noonan said in an interview with Online News Television in London.âThe mood from all the rating agencies is positive at present.âMoodyâs, which gave Ireland its top Aaa grade in 1998 before the euro was introduced, cut its rating on the nation to non-investment grade, or junk, in July 2011 following the financial collapse.âMoodyâs difficulty seems to be with the European Union and the euro zone, rather than with Ireland specifically,â Mr Noonan said. âThatâs what theyâve told us.âA junk rating cuts out some money managers, whose investment criteria stop them buying low-rated securities. Standard and Poorâs and Fitch Ratings, rank Ireland at BBB+, three levels above non-investment grade.The yield on Irelandâs 10-year bonds was little changed at 3.56 per cent today, leaving the yield difference, or spread, over similar-maturity German bunds at 1.70 percentage points.âWe decided to exit the bailout and do it cleanly without any precautionary programs or any dedicated credit lines. Weâre not jumping out of the plane without a parachute. We have cash buffers in excess of â¬20 billion. That funds up to the second quarter of 2015 if we never entered the market.âThe sale of â¬1.3 billion worth of Bank of Ireland preference shares by the Government earlier this weem was beyond his expectactions, he said.âA lot of people want to buy our paper. Weâre not junk, weâre doing fine,â he said.He also said there is no evidence that the countryâs lenders need more capital.Mr Noonan indicated heâll âtake time and seeâ what to do with the Stateâs 99.9 per cent stake in Allied Irish Bank, which is probably worth between â¬5 billion and â¬7 billion.He said he was still âhopefulâ on the Governmentâs campaign to win retroactive recapitalisation of the banking system.Online News
