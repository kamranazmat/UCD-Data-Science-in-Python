Photograph: Simon Dawson/Online NewsIcelandâs private sector is running out of cash to repay its foreign currency debt, according to the nationâs central bank.Non-krona debt owed by entities besides the Treasury and the central bank due through 2018 totals about 700 billion kronur (â¬4.3 billion), the bank said yesterday.The projected current account surpluses over the next five years arenât estimated to reach even half of that and will equal a shortfall of about 20 per cent of gross domestic product.The nation faces a ârepayment risk of foreign debt by private entities in the economy, who donât have access to foreign financial markets,â Sigridur Benediktsdottir, head of financial stability at the Reykjavik-based central bank, said yesterday in an interview.âWe view this as being exacerbated or made worse by the fact that our current account is actually declining.âPrime minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson has said Icelandâs foreign exchange shortfall is âa matter of huge concernâ as he tries to scale back currency controls in place since 2008.The governmentâs biggest challenge is to allow capital to flow freely without triggering a krona sell-off that would cause Icelandâs foreign debt to spike and undermine the nationâs economic recovery.Online News.
