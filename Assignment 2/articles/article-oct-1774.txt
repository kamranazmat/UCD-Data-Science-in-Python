Photograph: Aidan Crawley/Online NewsIrelandâs housing crash is finally showing signs of bottoming out, a new report from ratings agency Moodyâs has claimed.However, those expecting a significant recovery in prices may have to wait some time, with analysts noting a decline of around 50 per cent in house prices from their peak.House prices in Dublin have shown signs of recovery, with a recovery in house prices in Dublin and rising rents due to a shortage in supply, and improvements in Irelandâs macroeconomic environment boosting confidence among buyers. Cash investors have also been tempted back into the market by higher rents.âDespite these positive factors, the flat lending activities of Irish banks and the high outstanding household debt across the country will restrict the price recovery process,â the report said. âWhile prices will continue to slowly increase in Dublin, the temporary boost from cash buyers and supply restrictions will be insufficient to facilitate a significant recovery in prices.âMortgage arrears are showing signs of peaking, but Moodyâs said there were still âsubstantial lossesâ to be realised, with the impact of negative equity also to be taken into account.âThere are a substantial number of Irish borrowers with unsustainable debt levels. High losses from these borrowers are inevitable either through repossession or, more likely for the majority of cases, debt forgiveness,â Modyâs said.âWe expect 90+ day and 360+ day arrears to stabilise over the coming quarters, following the already observed decreasing trend in our 60-90 days arrears during 2012. Despite the stabilising trends, a substantial number of borrowers have already defaulted.â
