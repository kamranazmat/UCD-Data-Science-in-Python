Failures âcannot be explained awayâ by poor staffing levelsâNo staffing issue can explain away the lack of basic clinical care that took placeâ for  SavitaMinister for Health Dr James Reilly: âWe need to change the way weâre working and thatâs a much broader issue than the tragic case.âInadequate staffing levels in maternity units cannot âexplain awayâ the failure to provide basic care to Savita Halappanavar , Minister for Health James Reilly has said.Dr Reilly was responding yesterday to calls for an immediate increase in the number of consultants and midwives across the Stateâs 19 maternity units in light of the findings of the Health Information and Quality Authority investigation into Ms Halappanavarâs death.The health watchdogâs report, which was published on Wednesday, said: âThe HSE must review its workforce arrangements for maternity services nationally to ensure maternity teams are made up of sufficient numbers of staff with the right mix of skills and deployed effectively both during core and on-call hours.ââTragic circumstancesââNo staffing issue can explain away the lack of basic clinical care that took place in the tragic circumstances surrounding Savita Halappanavar,â he said.âIâm not saying we donât need more staff. I believe we will, but I do believe we have an opportunity to change the model of care as well . . .We need to change the way weâre working and thatâs a much broader issue than the tragic case.âDescribing the labour ward as a âcritical high-risk area for the pregnant patientâ, the report says: âThis area must involve direct supervision and care by hospital consultant staff and have 24-hours-a-day, seven-days-a-week senior midwifery coverâ.It points out that the 2003 Hanly report concluded there would need to be 191 consultant obstetrician gynaecologists in the State by 2013. At the end of last year, according to the HSE, there were 126. A 2006 report recommended that by 2016 there should be one consultant obstetrician-gynaecologist per 350 births.According to the authorityâs report, in Dublin and mid-Leinster there were 41 consultants and 22,445 births last year, or one consultant per 547 births. In Dublin North East there were 27 consultants and 14,551 births last year, or one per 538. In the HSE South region, there were 17,740 births last year and 31 consultants, or one per 572, and in HSE West, there were 15,606 births and 27 consultants, or one per 578 births.âAppalling indictmentâDr Reilly agreed with the characterisation by clinical director of the National Maternity Hospital , Dr Peter Boylan , of Ms Halappanavarâs death as an âappalling indictment of the Stateâs care for patientsâ.Dr Reilly said: âIt is an appalling indictment. But the rationale behind it now needs to be looked at and no amount of staffing can explain away the failure to care for the patient, to do basic things like taking blood pressure, measuring pulse rates, failure to recognise a patient is deteriorating, failing to recognise infection might be the real issue here, failure to follow up a blood test. Staffing [levels] canât explain that.âHe said he wanted staffing levels looked at âacross the systemâ and said he wanted âan appropriate level of staffing to an appropriate level of careâ.The Hiqa report pointed to 13 âmissed opportunitiesâ that, had they been identified and acted upon, could have resulted in a different outcome for Ms Halappanavar, who died in University Hospital Galway last October.
