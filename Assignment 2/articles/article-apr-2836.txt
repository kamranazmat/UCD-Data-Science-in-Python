HIV is an easily preventable condition and our goal should be zero new cases.âThe organisation has pointed out that due to the risk level, gay and bisexual men are more likely to test for the condition and to be treated quickly.Meanwhile, the HSEâs Gay Men Health Services (GMHS), which provides dedicated facilities in Ireland, held a community meeting on Saturday addressing a number of areas including the development of the service itself.Its most recent findings have shown that there is an increasing demand for services with 5,850 men attending clinics in 2012.Of those it says, 825 were first time attendees (an increase of 5 per cent on 2011) and 39 per cent were aged 24 or younger (an increase of 20 per cent).Some 37 per cent were born abroad while 17 per cent lived outside Dublin.The GMHS also noted that HIV testing increased by 39 per cent compared to 2011 and the number of medical consultations and STI screenings numbered 3,672.A breakdown of proportions showed that 44 per cent of Gonorrhoea and HIV cases, 35 per cent of Chlamydia and 32 per cent of syphilis were first time attendees.
