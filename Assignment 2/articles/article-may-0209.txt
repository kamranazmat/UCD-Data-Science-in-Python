The clinicâs fundraising literature states that although it is largely State-funded, it has a âsignificant annual shortfall which must be made up through voluntary donations and fundraisingâ.Steven Carroll, Pamela DuncanCharitable donations should not be used to fund âlavish salariesâ, Minister for Social Protection Joan Burton has said.Speaking at the Labour Party National Conference in Killarney tonight, Ms Burton said revelations about the use of donated funds to top-up salaries at the Central Remedial Clinic were âextremely disturbingâ.She said it was âvery importantâ that the organisation came out and clarified the issues that have been disclosed so far.Ms Burton said the CRC needed to provide details of its fundraising and additional sources of income and explain how that money is spent.âWhat happens after that depends on what they have to tell us,â she said. âI think they need to produce full accounting details and records and information in relation to it. Where it is inappropriate I would hope to see them change or modify that practice.âThe organisation yesterday admitted that money raised by a charitable company had been used to top up the salaries of staff including its former chief executive.Five senior staff at the Central Remedial Clinic (CRC) are still in receipt of top-up payments.The organisationâs then chief executive Paul Kiely, who was on a State salary of â¬106,900 prior to his retirement, received a further â¬136,000 supplemented by the clinic.Ms Burton said the public needed assurances that their generous donations to charities were being used for the purpose they hoped when selecting a charity to give money to.This was particularly important in the lead up to Christmas, which was an important fundraising period, she added.âIâm sure there is a huge amount of concern about the revelations because charity donations are not meant to fund lavish salaries way in excess of what the Taoiseach of the country is earning.âThe Taoiseach receives a salary of â¬185,350 annually.Earlier, Fundraising Ireland , an umbrella organisation for professional fundraisers including a number of well-known Irish charities, said its membersâ were reporting people cancelling their charitable donations as a result of the top up revelations.Chief executive Anne Hanniffy said the revelations were having a âdisproportionate and unfair impact on the funding efforts of charities and critically, people reliantâ on such charitiesâThis is concerning for hard-pressed organisations so openly reliant on public generosity and support,â she said.âIt is doubly concerning when the source of peopleâs frustration is an issue which has absolutely nothing to do with the way in which the vast majority of high quality not-for-profit organisations are funded and operated.âShe said Fundraising Ireland believed transparency, accountability and regulation were vital to any healthy institution: âWe owe it to donors that their money goes where they expect it to go,â she said..
