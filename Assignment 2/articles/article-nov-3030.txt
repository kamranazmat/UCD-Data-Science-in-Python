Ruth O'ConnorNew research on the mental health of young people has found 6 per cent of heterosexuals questioned had attempted suicide, but 19 per cent of gay or lesbian young people and 24 per cent of young bisexual people had attempted suicide at some point.BeLong To, the national organisation for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgendered young people, welcomed the research which was carried out for Headstrong, the National Centre for Youth Mental Health.âWe werenât surprised at the findings because they confirm previous research in Ireland which shows that LGBT young people are extremely vulnerable to mental health difficulties and that they are particularly at risk in the areas of depression and self-harm,â says Dr Carol-Anne OâBrien, advocacy co-ordinator for BeLong To Youth Services.ConcernDr OâBrien said that while the statistics were most concerning, it was also imperative to stress young LGBT people had support. âIt is important to mention that young people are not alone, that there is a network of services available and that there are important initiatives taking place within the schools.âWe want young people to know that the situation is not hopeless, improvement is happening . . . we see real change, but these young people can feel isolated,â she said.The research drawn from the My World Survey, a national survey examining the mental health of 8,221 young people in Ireland, points to young LGBT people and those unsure of their sexuality as being more at risk of isolation and bullying than others of the same age.People aged between 17 and 25 were asked about their sexual orientation, levels of distress, tendency to self-harm, experience of bullying, disordered eating behaviour and depression.In the anonymous, online questionnaire they were asked about the presence of âOne Good Adultâ whom they could turn to at difficult times.âWorryingly nearly one in four bisexual young people and one in five gay/lesbian young people in this study have at some point made an attempt on their life,â the report states.
