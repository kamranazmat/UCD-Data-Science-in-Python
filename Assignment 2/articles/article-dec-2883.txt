âGood shareâ of blame has to go to ECB and European Commission for not restructuring debtsJoseph Stiglitz: said it was a âdeep mistakeâ to bail out the bondholdersIreland is facing a lost decade as a result of the troika bailout, Nobel prize-winner Joseph Stiglitz said, as the country neared the end of its bailout programme.Speaking on RTÃ Radio 1 yesterday, Mr Stiglitz said it was a âdeep mistakeâ to bail out the bondholders. He said he was âastonishedâ at how Irish people accepted the situation without protest.âA good share of the blame has to go to the ECB and [European] Commission for not restructuring the debts,â Mr Stiglitz said.He said the ECB and others wanted to save the banks, âso it was a trade- off between banks all over Europe and the Irish citizensâ.He predicted a âlost decadeâ for the Irish economy before it got back on its feet, and the country would be unlikely to get back on the growth path it was previously on.âWill you get back to where you were with maybe a lost decade? Yes, I think you will. But it will be a lost decade, at least.âAusterity âessentially never workedâ he said, adding that the decision to stay in the euro was probably the right one.His comments came as the troika said Irelandâs programme remains âon track in the context of the nascent economic recoveryâ.
