The audit found that Our Ladyâs Hospital, Crumlin, was one of 13 agencies collectively paying about â¬900,000 to senior managers in top-up payments and benefits from non-State sources.A board member of the Stateâs largest childrenâs hospital, Our Ladyâs in Crumlin, has said the Health Service Executive salary scale for chief executives is not appropriate and needs to be changed.Cllr Ruairi McGinley, who sits on the board of Our Ladyâs Childrenâs Hospital and St Jamesâs Hospital Dublin, also said he would be dismayed if the controversy around top-up payments for senior executives impacted on fundraising.According to Department of Health files the chief executive of Our Ladyâs Hospital, Lorcan Birthistle , was receiving total remuneration of â¬140,808 of which â¬30,000 was described as a âprivately funded allowanceâ.The income stream used to fund this allowance is generated from profits from shops on the hospital campus.âIn terms of the commercial revenue being used to top it up to a reasonable rate, and a reasonable rate is a rate that would have applied to other CEOs of Dublin hospitals, I donât have an issue with that myself,â he told RTÃâs Morning Ireland .He described the HSEâs salary scale as inappropriate.âMy first point of call would be to change the HSEâs scale, but my second point would be to make a business case that says the current salary is justified.âMr McGinley said he was certain ââ¬110,000 is not an appropriate salary for a chief executive of a national childrenâs hospital.âHe said no one in the public service should earn more than the Taoiseachâs salary of â¬185,000 and added that the salary of the chief executive at Crumlin hospital was at was âat the lowest end of any of the numbers that have appearedâ.Mr McGinley said he hoped the publicity around top-up payments would notnegatively impact on fundraising.âThe salaries have been approved by the board, it is a limited company we do have responsibilities totally separate to the Minister,â he said.Mr McGinley said he would not support trying to recoup top up payments paid to the chief executive.He added that the board would not have dealt with the chief executiveâs salary and said it would have been appointed before his term on the board.âThe issue I would have is people in the public service earning more than the Taoiseach salary at â¬185,000 and I would reduce all salaries above this level.âDetails of the payment emerged in confidential Department of Health files obtained by The Online News which set out publicly for the first time the total amount, including top-up payments, made to individual members of senior management across State-funded voluntary hospitals and health agencies..
