Photograph: Online News/Lisi NiesnerThe European Central Bank yesterday issued a warning of the threat posed by the scaling back of monetary stimulus in the US.It called on the currency blocâs policymakers to prepare for the ill effects of Federal Reserve tapering.The ECB said in its latest financial stability report that the risks to the euro zoneâs financial system from outside the currency bloc had grown since May on the back of the Federal Reserveâs talk of tapering its $85 billion worth of monthly bond purchases, despite a general improvement in market conditions.âStarting in May, there was a significant repricing in global bond markets, which took place largely because of changing monetary policy expectations in the United States â with increased foreign exchange market volatility and stress borne largely by emerging market economies,â the ECB said.The ECB warned that, while the euro zoneâs institutional investors were more exposed to bond markets than the regionâs lenders, it was difficult to know where the risks of ultimate losses were greatest.âIt cannot be ruled out that ultimate exposures are concentrated among a limited number of entities which may now be more vulnerable to any further severe market shock,â the ECB said.Insurance companiesâSuch losses are potentially compounded by an environment of historically low prevailing yields in some countries, which continues to constitute a risk for institutional investors such as insurance companies.âThe ECB said weak bank profitability and persistent financial fragmentation still presented a threat to stability. Banking union would be âan important contributionâ to resolving these hurdles.âLatest Economy
